# Mountain will transform into this field if one of the moves Eruption, Inferno Overdrive, Lava Plume, or Magma Drift is used.
# The mountain erupted!
# Snowy Mountain will transform into this field if either of the moves Eruption or Magma Drift is used.
# The mountain erupted!
# Infernal Field will transform into this field if one of the moves Judgment, Origin Pulse, or Purify is used.
# The hellish landscape was purified!

# Bulldoze, Earthquake, Earth Power, Eruption, Fever Pitch, Lava Plume, Magma Drift, Magnitude, Precipice Blades - all cause eruption
# The ability Desolate Land causes an eruption at the end of each turn.
# Pokémon are immune to the eruption if they are under the effects of Aqua Ring, or Wide Guard, or have one of the following abilities:
# Battle Armor, Blaze, Flare Boost, Flame Body, Flash Fire, Magic Guard, Magma Armor, Prism Armor, Shell Armor, Solid Rock, Sturdy, Water Bubble, Wonder Guard
# Pokémon affected by Tar Shot take x2 damage from the eruption.

# The following abilities will activate after an eruption:
# Blaze and Flash Fire are activated.
# Magma Armor boosts the bearer's Defense and Special Defense by 1 stage, and makes the bearer immune to Fire-type moves.
# Flare Boost boosts the bearer's Special Attack by 1 stage.
# Sleeping Pokémon are woken up after an eruption, unless they have the ability Soundproof. 
# The field is cleared of hazards and Leech Seed after an eruption. 

# Gale Wings is always activated if Strong Winds are blowing.
# Ice Face melts on switch-in.
# Burn Up's effect resets at the end of the turn.
# Outrage, Petal Dance, and Thrash now cause fatigue after 1 turn.
# Poison Gas now inflicts badly poisoned status.
# Raging Fury does not Confuse.
# Smokescreen lowers the target's Accuracy by 2 stages.
# Stealth Rock deals Fire-type damage instead.
# Tailwind lasts 6 turns and creates Strong Winds for its duration.
#Any move in this section inherently gains a 1.3x damage boost if it changes the field, unless noted otherwise.

    #This field will transform into Sky Field if either Bounce or Fly is used.
      #  The battle was taken to the skies!
   # This field will transform into Mountain if one of the moves Blizzard, Glaciate is used.
    #    The field cooled off!
