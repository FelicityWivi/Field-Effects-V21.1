# Transitions to Other Fields
# Any move in this section inherently gains a 1.3x damage boost if it changes the field, unless noted otherwise.
#The following moves will transform this field into Cave. If Water Surface or Murkwater Surface are below this field, the field will transform to that instead.
# The field will transform into Water Surface if Scald is used 2 times, or Steam Eruption is used 1 time. If Cave is below this field, the field will transform to that instead.
#    Parts of the ice melted!
#    The hot water melted the ice!
#The following moves will transform this field into Water Surface or Murkwater Surface if either of those fields are below this field.
#    Bulldoze, Dive, Earthquake, Fissure, Magnitude, Tectonic Rage
#    The quake broke up the ice and revealed the water beneath!
#    The ice was broken from underneath!
