# Transitions to other fields #
# This field will transform into Swamp Field if Surf is used 3 times or Muddy Water is used 2 times.

#    Specifically, using Surf increments the counter by +1 and using Muddy Water increments it by +2. The field changes to Swamp Field when the counter is >= 3. #
#    The ground became waterlogged... #
#    The forest became marshy! #
